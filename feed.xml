In the third article of this series, we look at extracting a subset of the network data, like \(S_{11}\) or \(S_{21}\), either as a network object or as a numpy array. Learning to manipulate network data is important for calculations that can be performed on the data later on, such as lumped e... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Scikit-RF Tutorial (2) - The Network() Class</title><link href="https://vik-s.github.io/posts/The-Network-Class/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Scikit-RF Tutorial (2) - The Network() Class" /><published>2021-01-09T20:40:20-08:00</published> <updated>2021-02-07T06:27:34-08:00</updated> <id>https://vik-s.github.io/posts/The-Network-Class/</id> <content src="https://vik-s.github.io/posts/The-Network-Class/" /> <author> <name>Vikram Sekar</name> </author> <category term="Python" /> <category term="scikit-rf" /> <summary> In this article, we will look into the fundamentals of the Network() class. It is a fundamental building block of the scikit-rf package, and we will use it repeatedly to wrangle rf network data. Learning to work with objects derived from this class will go a long way in getting proficient with the use of this python package. For your reference, here is a list of articles in this series.

This post is the first of a series of blog posts on RF and microwave analysis using python. At first, I thought I will design this to be a course with a limited number of modules, but as I wrote the content, I decided to adapt into a running series that I can keep adding to. The field of RF and microwaves is vast and it is better not to set boundaries. It will also keep me motivated to... </summary> </entry> </feed>
