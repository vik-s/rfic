Hi, and thanks for visiting this blog! :wave:

My name is Vikram and I have spent over a decade in the semiconductor industry working on front-end RFIC technologies, in small, medium and large companies. I currently work as an RF device modeling engineer. I am an avid python enthusiast, open source contributor and [rock guitarist](https://blackearth.in/).

In this blog, I write about  RF engineering in general with a focus on integrated circuits. I talk about basic RF concepts, simulation tools, measurement methods, design approaches, and programming. I hope you will enjoy reading these articles, as much as I enjoy writing them!
